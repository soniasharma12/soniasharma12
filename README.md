👩🏽‍💻 As an aspiring data scientist, computer programmer, and A.I devotee. I desire to contribute to making our technology-driven world a better place from both the design and development aspects of software. I would like to pursue Computer Science since I find fulfillment working on impactful software and technology projects. 


😊 I enjoy learning from new experiences, collaborating on complex problems, and figuring out how to make the most effective decision. I am passionate to learn and love to be challenged!
