# Hi, I’m Sonia 👋🏽👩🏽‍💻

🌱 As an aspiring data scientist, computer programmer, and A.I devotee. I desire to contribute to making our technology-driven world a better place from both the design and development aspects of software. I would like to pursue Computer Science since I find fulfillment working on impactful software and technology projects. Additionally, I consider myself a dedicated, hardworking, and detail-oriented individual, which I believe are crucial skills one should have in order to pursue within this line of work.


😊 I enjoy learning from new experiences, collaborating on complex problems, and figuring out how to make the most effective decision. I am passionate to learn and love to be challenged!
